Activity: compute budget using a while loop
===========================================

Much of the work of a university administration (in addition to managing teachers, 
researchers, students, courses, etc.) is to ensure the proper functioning of the university 
and in particular that the accounting job is well done. Once a year, an annual report of 
expenditures must be made.

All expenses for the year have been recorded and classified in a multitude of files and 
the sum of all these expenses must now be calculated. But no one knows exactly how many 
different expenses have been made in the past year!

Your program will have to read a sequence of positive integers and display their sum. 
We do not know how many integers there will be, but the sequence always ends with 
the value -1 (which is not an expense, just an end marker).

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    
    int sum=0, expense=0;
    
    while(expense != -1){
        sum += expense;
        scanf("%d", &expense);
    }
    
    printf("%d", sum);
    
    return 0;
}
